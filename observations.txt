GOAL: Query patient notes with a feature and return locations with the closest matches
    - Get an idea of what train.csv annotates and its importance

* Features.csv
    - Split by OR
    - Usually when abbreviations, the OR is the full abbreviated word
    - Possible to make another column for "abbreivations-exist"
    - Synonyms of the features or similar words should match???
    - Lots of variation for a "simple" feature
        - 801: son died 3 weeks ago => not based on time, merely on if son died
        - 112: female/f => context behind it usually has age preceding

* patient_notes.csv
    - Capital letters sometimes important(for abbreivations)
    - Many, MANY abbreviations that will be tough to transform them all
